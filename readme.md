## - Introduction

The repository counts with the following files:

1. `cleaned.csv` This is the output of cleanning the data.
1. `ml_challenge.pdf` This is the challenge itself, its demands, requirements and questions.
1. `report.ipynb` This is where the main answer are located.
1. `requirements.txt` This is the file with all dependencies for installation. (use pip install for this).
1. `transactions.csv` This is the raw data file.

## - About the project file

The project file (`report.ipynb`) is a jupyter notebook which is divided into 3 parts:

1. **Imports:** This will focus on importing all necessary data and modules.
1. **Data Assessing:** The focus is to familiarize with the data and assess the state of data.
1. **Questions:** This is were we solve the questions given by the challenge.

## - Project Setup with Miniconda

This README provides instructions for setting up a Python environment using Miniconda, creating a virtual environment with Python 3.11.9, and installing the required packages for this project.

### 1. Install Miniconda

#### Windows

1. Download the Miniconda installer for Windows from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
3. Open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.

#### macOS and Linux

1. Download the Miniconda installer for your system from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.
3. Run the following command, replacing `Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh` with the name of the file you downloaded:
   ```
   bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
5. Close and reopen your terminal.

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

After installing Miniconda, create a new environment with Python 3.11.9:

```
conda create -n MyWayEnviroment python=3.11.9
```

Replace `MyWayEnviroment` with your desired environment name.

### 3. Activate the Environment

Activate the newly created environment:

```
conda activate MyWayEnviroment
```

### 4. Install Requirements

Assuming you have a `readme.txt` file with the required packages, install them using pip:

```
pip install -r readme.txt
```

If you don't have a `readme.txt` file, create one with the required packages listed one per line, then run the above command.

### 5. Verify Installation

You can verify the installation by checking the Python version and installed packages:

```
python --version
pip list
```
